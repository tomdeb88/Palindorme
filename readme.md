# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards

## Functioning in Python

By comparing a string and its reversed version we can find out if a word is a Palindrome.
Additionaly we lowercase the word to avoid case sensivity.
